# Swift Registry

^
- Publish to a locally-running swift registry
  `swift package-registry publish marcelo-es.swell 0.0.1 --url http://localhost:8080 --allow-insecure-http`
- Set the registry for marcelo-es in the local package
  `swift package-registry set http://localhost:8080 --scope marcelo-es --allow-insecure-http`
- Restart Xcode

# What sort of üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è is this?

^
It's no witchery
Swift Registry has been implemented in SwiftPM since Swift 5.7 (Xcode 14)
It's has an online spec (show website)
SwiftPM has the tooling, but it's not the server

Implementation of the Swift Registry

# Swift Birdhouse
[.build-lists: true]

- Pure to the specs
- Built with Hummingbird 2 (`2.0.0-rc.1`)
- Has as few dependencies as we can get away with
- Blazing fast and light on runtime
- Not ready for production
  - yet!

---

# Show me ü™µ!

^
Show logs on swift-birdhouse
Show intraction with RapidAPI
Also show Package.resolved

# Scopes?

^
Scopes give you means of having packages coming from different registries.
